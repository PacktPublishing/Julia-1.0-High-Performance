This is the code repository for [Julia High Performance](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/julia-10-high-performance), published by Packt.

**Optimizations, distributed computing, multithreading, and GPU programming with Julia 1.0 and beyond**

## What is this book about?
Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. If you want to understand how to avoid bottlenecks and design your programs for the highest possible performance, then this book is for you. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
- Understand how Julia code is transformed into machine code
- Measure the time and memory taken by Julia programs 
- Create fast machine code using Julia's type information 
- Define and call functions without compromising Julia's performance 
- Accelerate your code via the GPU
- Use tasks and async IO for responsive programs
- Run Julia programs on large distributed clusters

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter03.

The code will look like the following:
```
struct Pixel{T} 
    x::Int64 
    y::Int64 
    color::T 
end
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for beginners and intermediate Julia programmers who are interested in high-performance technical programming. A basic knowledge of Julia programming is assumed.
